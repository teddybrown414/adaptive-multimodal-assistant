## Local LLMs 🔒

Harnessing models via `Langchain` and `ChatOllama`, hosted locally with `Ollama`, offers numerous benefits in terms of customization. This setup allows for tailored model configurations that align with specific project requirements, enabling developers to fine-tune performance and functionalities.
`Ollama server` will be running on the Kaggle notebook due to the limitation of storage and processors of local machines.
